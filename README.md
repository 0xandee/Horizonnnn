# Aztec Horizon

**Aztec Horizon** is where the Renaissance of privacy begins. Here, we forge bold, open source experiments that reveal what privacy-first blockchains can unlock for humanity.

Aztec is not just another zk rollup—it is the foundation for applications that respect privacy by default.
Horizon is where these architectural visions are shaped, coordinated, and accelerated into reality.
Our mission is to prove that the next wave of private applications is not a distant vision—it is already under construction, and you are invited to build the future with us.
