# Private Prediction Markets - Positioning Framework

## üéØ ICP:
Privacy-conscious and whale traders who want to participate in prediction markets without revealing their positions, beliefs, or winnings.

## üí• Problem:
Public prediction market positions enable front-running, whale coordination, herding behavior, market manipulation, and doxxing/targeting of users based on their beliefs and financial stakes.

## üíé Value Proposition:
We help **privacy-conscious prediction market traders** **access Polymarket's deep liquidity and proven resolution** by **encrypting all positions on Aztec while mirroring Polymarket markets**.

**Proof bullets:**
- Privacy-preserving prediction markets address documented manipulation (UMA Zelensky market dispute coordination)
- Aztec's zero-knowledge rollup technology enables production-ready encrypted state
- Polymarket's top 50 markets provide $X million daily volume (validate specific numbers)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Product Snapshot
**What's live:** PRD complete with 12-section specification, privacy model designed, technical architecture scoped

**Access:** [PRD link: `/PRDs/Private_Prediction_Markets.md`]

**Who's testing:** Internal review

**What we learned:**
- Oracle trust is critical risk ‚Üí mitigated with 24hr delay + future multi-oracle consensus
- MVP should start simple (top 50 markets, individual trades) before adding batching complexity
- No-fee model for MVP accelerates adoption and proves privacy concept first

**Next step:** Seek technical review from Aztec developers, validate oracle architecture feasibility

## üìà Early Metrics / Validation Signals

**Hypothesis:** We believe **whale traders and privacy-conscious users** will **migrate from Polymarket** if we **offer identical markets with complete position privacy**.

**Validation signals:**
- User interviews with Polymarket power users about privacy concerns and willingness to switch
- Feedback from Aztec developer community on technical feasibility and L2 readiness
- Market evidence of manipulation/front-running on public prediction markets (UMA disputes, whale copy-trading)

**Interpretation:** If 10+ Polymarket users express strong interest and willingness to seed liquidity, and Aztec developers confirm oracle architecture is viable, proceed to MVP build phase.

## üß≠ Positioning Statement
**For** privacy-conscious traders, whale investors, and institutional participants

**who** need to express conviction on real-world events without revealing positions or attracting front-runners,
**we** provide a privacy-preserving prediction market platform

**that** mirrors Polymarket's liquidity and resolution while encrypting all positions on Aztec.

**(because** Polymarket's public positions enable herding, manipulation, and targeting‚Äîand Aztec's zero-knowledge rollups finally make encrypted prediction markets technically viable**)**

## Next Actions

1. **Validate market metrics**: Research current Polymarket volume data for top 50 markets
2. **User research**: Conduct 10-15 interviews with active Polymarket traders about privacy pain points
3. **Technical validation**: Connect with Aztec core developers to validate oracle architecture
